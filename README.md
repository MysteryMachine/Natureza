# Natureza

Natureza is an experimental, in the works RTS style roguelike written in
Clojure and Arcadia. It is being developed in tandem with (folha)[https://github.com/MysteryMachine/folha].
No screenshots or info will be included here until the game is playable (which won't happen for a long while).
